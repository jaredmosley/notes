must be called with the exact number of parameters
can declare that it throws CHECKED exceptions

static methods
    can not be abstract
    can only access static variables
    ex.
        public static int hello(int x){};
    can not be overridden by a non-static method and vice-versa

final
    can not be overridden

overriding
    must have same signature
        name and parameter list
    return type
        primitives must be the same
        objects must be same or subclass
    can make it MORE accessible
    concrete subclass must override parent abstract classes' methods
        otherwise subclass will be abstract too
    private methods cant be overridden
    declared exceptions can be a subset of original method
        can also throw an instance of a subclass of declared exception
    must both be static or non-static

main method
    signature
        public, static, void
        takes String[] args
            cant be called from commandline without this
            never  null
                if no args then array of length 0
    runtime exception (NOT COMPILATION ERROR) if signature is incorrect
