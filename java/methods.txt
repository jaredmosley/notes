must be called with the exact number of parameters
can declare that it throws CHECKED exceptions

static methods
    can not be abstract
    can only access static variables
        can not access "this" reference
    ex.
        public static int hello(int x){};
    can not be overridden by a non-static method and vice-versa

final
    can not be overridden

abstract
    must be inside an abstract class

overloading
    name
        must be the same
    return type
        can be different or the same
    parameters
        must be different
            amount
            order

overriding
    must have same signature
        name and parameter list
    return type
        primitives
            must be the same
        objects
            covariant
                must be same or subclass
    can make it MORE accessible
    concrete subclass must override parent abstract classes' methods
        otherwise subclass will be abstract too
    private methods cant be overridden
    declared exceptions
        must be a subset of original method
            including an instance of a subclass of declared exception
    must both be static or non-static

main method
    signature
        public, static, void
        takes String[] args
            cant be called from commandline without this
            never  null
                if no args then array of length 0
    runtime error (NOT COMPILATION ERROR) if signature is incorrect
