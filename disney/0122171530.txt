windows servers now enrolling
    josey and ??? (matt?) to test

defect scrum from last week
    Problem
        only had logon on left nav panel of scureit pilot
            no request access or anything
    cause
        logged out
    solution
        log in

logging into client
    connect to servers only
    can not request server access


as400
    terminal emulation not available
        can still ssh in
    CAPAM is implementing a solution

personally assigned accounts
    LAR (process to request them)
        going away
    should they be permitted?

server enrollment
    need to have all 3 accounts

request string for each server enrollment request
    should be in human-readable format?

delete your own access
    can not right now
    bring josey in to check

direct reports
    load users button
        see which users have access
    bringing josey in to check

half of servers needed to enroll
    not going to be enrolled
    might be more stringent than necessary

deleting someone elses access
    pop-up to confirm removal
    auto-removal
        marked inactive immediately
        should be within 12 hours
            idr: 4 hours
            keystone: several times a day
