    see how long request calls are taking

            siadmin works fine but siuser does not(?)
        giving her siadmin temporarily for testing
            could log into siadmin
            could then log into siuser
        siuser password was out of sync
            matt put it back into sync while josey was logging into siadmin

        went through enrollment api
    not there
        might still be enrolled

go through enrolled servers
    change so accounts arent managing their own credentials
